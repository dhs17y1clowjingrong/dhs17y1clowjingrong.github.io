<h2>Review</h2>
<p>
Newt Scamander arrives in the city nearing the end of a global excursion to research and rescue magical creatures,
some of which are safeguarded in the hidden pocket-dimensions of his deceptively nondescript leather case.
But potential disaster strikes when unsuspecting No-Maj Jacob Kowalski inadvertently lets some of Newt's beasts loose in a city already on 
edge - a serious breach of the Statute of Secrecy that former Auror Tina Goldstein jumps on, seeing her chance to regain her post. However,
things take an ominous turn when Percival Graves, the enigmatic Director of Magical Security at MACUSA (Magical Congress of the United States of America),
casts his suspicions on both Newt, and Tina.
Now allied, Newt and Tina, together with Tina's sister, Queenie, and their new No-Maj friend, Jacob, form a band of unlikely heroes,
who must recover Newt's missing beasts before they come to harm.
But the stakes are higher than these four outsiders - now branded fugitives - ever imagined, 
as their mission puts them on a collision course with dark forces that could push the Wizarding and No-Maj worlds to the brink of war</p>
